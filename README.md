# CopulaOne - An R package

This project is to build an R package that implements a very flexible bivariate parametric copula.

Bivariate copulas have been widely used either in modeling bivariate dependence structures or building multivariate dependence models such as Vine copulas and factor copulas. In the literature, there are numurous parametric bivariate copula families. It is often very time consuming to select copula families from many different candidate copula families. The R package CopulaOne aims at implementing a very flexible bivariate copula that is parsimonious but very flexible and has the capicity of capturing most bivariate dependence patterns.
